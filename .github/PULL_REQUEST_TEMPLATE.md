Thank you for contributing to Ferrite Core.
Pull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed
immediately. Code comments are recommended and encouraged.

<!--
Please provide a brief explanation of how 
Ferrite Core user or developer experience is improved:

* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.
* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or
  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover
  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests
  should accompany the change.
* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an
  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug
  was fixed.
* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.
  Contributors should first consider building the system outside of Ferrite Core, if possible.
* Note that code style is often a subjective matter. 
  Unless explicitly mentioned in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), 
  stylistic code changes are usually rejected.

<!--
Ferrite Core has a thorough review process and changes
need time and effort to review. 
There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, 
so patches may sit for a long time until the next release.
Thank you for your patience.
